# sipec.github.io (deprecated)

My old personal site.
Now just redirects to [sincl.ai](https://sincl.ai) ([source](https://github.com/sipec/personal-site))

Well, it still has [my old games](https://github.sipec.io/projects).

And my [Extra Eats project notes](https://sipec.github.io/project.html). But really, you should go to the repo [SCU-Sustainability/extra-eats](https://github.com/SCU-Sustainability/extra-eats) for the actual Flutter app instead.
