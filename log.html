	<h3>15 Apr</h3>
	<p>
		Me and the design team met with Nate. The meeting was orignally just between Nate and the design team, but Elissa invited me last minute so that I could communicate back to the tech team what was discussed. We talked about project timelines and Nate's role in the project. Apparently Nate's own team at the Center for Sustainability has been designing this app for quite a while. I asked Nate for the github link; he's surprised we haven't gotten it yet. After the meeting I find the <a href="https://github.com/jonnylin13/taste-the-waste">link to Jonny's repo</a> and share with the team.
	</p>
	<h3>18 Apr</h3>
	<p>
		I had arranged a meeting with Jonny (the lead programmer from last quarter) and was planning on showing up today, but I had a schedule conflict at the last minute. I think Aastha was the only one who ended up talking to him in person.
	</p>
	<h3>19 Apr</h3>
	<p>
		I downloaded the code and the Flutter SDK, Following <a href="https://github.com/jonnylin13/taste-the-waste/wiki/Setup">Jonny's setup instructions.</a> We are still awaiting the access codes

	<h3>23 Apr</h3>
	<p>
		Logged into the "offical" github and made sure that there were no differences between it's code and ours. Made a facebook messenger group chat with the tech team and Jonny. See <a href="teamlog.html">team log</a> for more details.
	</p>
	<h3>24 Apr</h3>
	<p>
		My computer breaks - it won't turn on even when plugged in. This might be because I borrowed Jazzy's charger yesterday and its voltage is different. I proceed to waste too much time in the next few days trying to fix it myself. I also wait too long before informing my team about this.

	<h3>28-29 Apr</h3>
	<p>
		Bought a new computer at bestbuy, and set up everything all over again. I was not able to get the UI to display this time.
	</p>
	<h3>30 Apr</h3>
	<p>
		During class, finished getting the UI to dislay. Got past the login screen by changing <code>_is_logged_in()</code> to always return true. Updated the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XqJAMltySMIff326SmyOpSn7QbAYWZ26hbyieuDp6B0/edit?usp=sharing">GANTT chart</a> so it has dates and tasks.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>EDIT:</strong> It is not up to date. If you're us, check the team drive, the issues are in a google doc unless I moved them to the github. If you're Dr. JAK maybe you should tell us off for trying to use a spreadsheet for the GANTT chart instead of some dedicated GANTT software that isn't terrible.
	</p>

	<h3>2 May</h3>
	<p>
		Changed the <a href="https://github.com/SCU-Sustainability">SCU-Sustainability github</a> from an account into a github organization. What this means is that you can no longer log into SCU-Sustainability. Instead, after this quarter is over I will transfer owership of the organization to Lindsey. (In practice that probably means transferring it to the github of someone on Nate's team to act as Lindsey's regent.) I started adding everyone to the organization, except I don't add Aastha and Francesca until Sunday because I didn't know their github handles and I forgot about the whole thing until then.

	<h3>5 May</h3>
	<p>
		Met with team. Added Aastha and Francesca to <a href="https://github.com/SCU_Sustainability">SCU-Sustainability</a>. After Jonny showed up, I told him to move his taste-the-waste repository to it. During the meeting I was able to get lots of stuff working on my actual phone (not emulator) including taking photos, notifications, and seeing posts in the feed.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also changed the logos and the name to Extra Eats and added a button to upload an image from the gallery. Check out my <a href="https://github.com/SCU-Sustainability/taste-the-waste/commits/master">commits</a>.

	<h3>9 May</h3>
	<p>
		Upgraded to most recent version of dart. I regret everything.
