	<h3>9 Apr</h3>
	<p>
		The full team met with Lindsey. We discussed timeline and project expectations, decided focus was on improving performance over making new features. Design team worked out how we were going to gather data and user-test this app. <a href="project req 4-9">Notes</a>
	</p>
	<h3>13 Apr</h3>
	<p>
		We finalized the <a href="Contract.pdf">team contract</a>
	</p>

	<div class="revealedcontent">
	<h3>15 Apr</h3>
	<p>
		Shared <a href="https://github.com/jonnylin13/taste-the-waste"> Jonny's repo</a> with the team. More details in <a href = "log.html">personal log</a>.
	</p>
	<h3>18 Apr</h3>
	<p>
		Aastha met with Jonny and shares the information with the team.
	</p>
	</div>


	<button class="collapsible">Week 4</button>
	<div class="revealedcontent">
	<h3>22 Apr</h3>
	<p>
		We made the <a href="gantt_0.pdf">GANTT chart</a> [Edit: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XqJAMltySMIff326SmyOpSn7QbAYWZ26hbyieuDp6B0/edit?usp=sharing">Updated Chart</a>]. However, at the time we did not actually use this to do any planning, we just recorded what had been done so far.
	</p>
	<h3>23 Apr</h3>
	<p>
		Two people got trained. Me, Aastha, and I think Frencesca worked on the project. Aastha told me that she found the login information for the Center for Sustainability's gmail and github on Emily Zhang's weekly log from last quarter. (The login information has been removed, as far as I can tell)
	</p>
	<p>
		After training finished, the five of us got together and each individually worked on getting the app to run on our own computers. The UI team asked us when the app would be done, and we didn't know. Aastha told them that we would update the GANTT chart in the shared drive after seeing the what the app looks like (but we never did.) After Jonny told us over facebook messenger the updated environment variables, I was able to get the user interface to display on my android emulator. However Jonny is surprised by this and thinks this means the build is off.
	</p>

	<button class="collapsible">Week 5</button>
	<div class="revealedcontent">
	<h3>30 Apr</h3>
	<p>
		During class, we continued the setup and touched base with the UI team.

	<div class="revealedcontent">
	<h3>5 May</h3>
	<p>
		At 1:30pm, the team met with Jonny, and he gave us the environment variables needed to connect to his personal mongoDB database. We finally got both the client and server to work, using these credentials. He also transfered ownership of the taste-the-waste git repository to the SCU-Sustainability github organization. I asked him to do this because this way we could have a common history of the work done and also any links or commits to Jonny's repo (and the wiki) will get automatically redirected to SCU-Sustainability's repo.
	</p>
	<p>This is what we got working:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>"Registration and Logins"
			<ul>
				<li>Looks like it works but no email validation or single sign on.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Posting from one device and recieving it in the feed of another device.</li>
		<li>Picture taking, allergen info, description and time for posts.
			<ul>
				<li>Posts correctly dissappear after time is over</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Notifications on Android (from other people's posts)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		That is all work from last quarter. Additionally we made a list of coding tasks to based on the issues we found, and we agreed not to put it onto the GANTT chart because honestly it's kind of a bother and hard to read. Instead we did it in google docs. I personally think we should migrate to github's issue tracker
	</p>

	<h3>6 May</h3>
	<p>We finished the <a href="reflection1.pdf">first reflection</a> on our progress so far.</p>
	</div>

	<button class="collapsible">Week 7</button>
	<div class="revealedcontent">
	<h3>13 May</h3>
	<p>
		We finished the slides for the progress report tomorrow
	</p>
	
	<h3>14 May</h3>
	<p>
		We did the progress report.	Lindsey wants us to remove allergen information. Not a popular decision.
	</p>

	<button class="collapsible">Week 8</button>
	<div class="revealedcontent">
	<h3>21 May</h3>
	<p>
		Me and the team made a lot of progress today. (Frencesca was sick so she wasn't there.) After we touched base with Dr. JAK and with the design team, we went to a Heafey focus room. They wanted me to show them how to edit the UI because I was the only one who has done it so far, but my computer was slow, so we connected Aastha's computer to the big screen over the hdmi cable and I edited the code using her computer. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Matt asked me to add a checkbox on the submit post page that the user would click on in order to change the post time. I strongly disagreed. I thought it would be more elegant to simply show the default post time and have it change if the user clicks on it, but they felt like it was not clear to the user that the time is changeable. I suggested going to the design team to ask for their opinion on how to change the interface,but Matt insisted that it wasn't a design issue but a question of how the schedule data will be sent to the backend. (The point is moot - the design team already left, when I went to check.) 
	</p>
	<p>
		In the end, I decided to just go along with it and use the checkbox, knowing that we would run it by the design team later anyways. With that out of the way, the rest of the session was very rewarding. It was fun <del>pair</del> quadruple programming with the three of them - there was a lot of back and forth, helpful suggestions, and jokes. I hope we can do it more in the future.
	</p>

	<h3>22 May</h3>
	<p>Matt, Aastha, and Sreya met in the afernoon. I also came later but they were mostly done by then.</p>
	</div>
	<button class='collapsible'>Week 9</button>
	<div class='revealedcontent'>
	<h3>28 May</h3>
	<p>
		Me, Aastha, and Sreya met with Lindsey to discuss the allergen tags. After discussing, she changed her mind and approved it, as long as it's optional for the event planner and that the language makes it clear that the tags aren't definitive.
	</p>
	
	<h3>30 May</h3>
	<p>
		After talking with Elissa about my availability, we agreed to move the demo to tomorrow.
	</p>

	<h3>31 May </h3>
	<p>
		I joined the design team to do a demo of the app. We offered people free donuts from Krispy Kreme on the condition that they test the app and fill out a short survey about it. I was there to run the server locally on my computer. I don't know why, but the app didn't work on Elissa's device, even after I gave her a fresh version, so we ended up just using my phone to demo because it worked on mny phone.
	</p>

	<button class="collapsible">Week 10</button>
	<div class="revealedcontent">
	<h3>2 June</h3>
	<p>
		The whole tech team met at 6pm to work on the project. Aastha, Sreya, and Francesca were able to get the app and server to run eventually. Also during this time, Matt worked on some more server stuff, and me and Francesca made post deleting work. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Aastha (and Sreya) convinced us that the logo with the bowl was inferior to Nate's logo with the eco-tray, however Aastha failed to convince us to do much about it. Aastha some time on groupme, trying to convince the UI team to use Nate's logo. 
	</p>

	<h3>3 June</h3>
	<p>
		We quickly finish the slides.
	</p>

	<h3>4 June</h3>
	<p>
		Matt gets post scheduling to work.
