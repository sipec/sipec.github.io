	<h1>Hi! I'm Sinclair</h1>

	<p>
		I graduated from Santa Clara University in June 2019 with a major in CS and a minor in math. My pronouns are she/her or they/them. I like tabletop games and going on long hikes. I think the world might end soon and I'm trying to do my part to make sure that doesn't happen.

		I know this page is sparse right now. I'm planning on remaking this website using Flutter whenever Flutter for web comes out. I'm currently in the process of adding my old projects here, but for now, check out my <a href="project.html">design notebook</a> for my Community Based Engineering Design class.

		Don't forget to get lots of sleep!
