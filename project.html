	<h1>Extra Eats</h1>
	<p>
	I'm Sinclair, a third-year who is about to graduate from Santa Clara University. This is my design notebook for ENGR 110: Community Based Engineering Design, and our project is Extra Eats, a cross-platform food sharing app developed by the SCU Sustainability Center. The application is built with Flutter, and our API on a Node.js application deployed to Heroku (or at least that's what the last team said. This might change)
